### Code Style

We are using ESlint to enfore the style "Standard" with small modifications, for example we like our semicolons. Make sure to run `npm run lint` to make sure your code follows the style guide.

### Testing

All functions must have a corresponding test file in the `tests` folder of the same name. Tests should have **100%** coverage at all times. We are using `jest` for testing.

#### To run the tests:

npm run test

#or

npm t
```
